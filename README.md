# Tweets

> get statistics from array of tweet-cards

## Description and Usage

The application consists of two pages:

- Home welcome page
- Tweet cards page.

The `Home` page has a link button to go to the Tweets page.

When you visit the `Tweets` page, a starter set of tweet cards is automatically
downloaded. Pagination has been implemented in the cards display list: when you
click on the `Load More` button, the next batch of tweet cards is loaded. If the
list of cards has come to an end, the pagination button disappears.

The page header now has the ability to filter cards by third parameters: show
all cards without sorting, show cards without a subscription, and show cards
that you have subscribed to.
